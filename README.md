# TheCoordinator
A Firefox extension which extracts cache coordinates from the pages of geocaching websites

The coordinates can then be extracted either as text (semicolon-separated) or as a GPX file.

This extension is based heavily on the `gpx_creator` extension by gishroni at https://github.com/gishroni/gpx_creator/ 
and also the `Beastify` example from Mozilla at https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/beastify
